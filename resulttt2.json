            "Hi, Stephen.Thank you for reaching out.The HackerRank you were sent was based on the answers you selected in your application. Feel free to not answer any of the Math questions and just the programming questions. This will not penalize your score as we will only assess on the programming section. We will review and be in touch regarding next steps in the coming weeks. Please check your application portal for the latest update.Best,Engineering Campus Recruiting TeamFrom: Stephen Luong Sent: Saturday, August 24, 2024 3:08 PMTo: Goldman Sachs Campus Recruiting - Engineering Subject: 2024 Goldman Sachs Engineering -- Programming QuestionHi,First, my name is Tri Cuong Luong, an applicant of Goldman Sachs' Engineering program for the 2024 cycle. I saw an invitation email to do the technical assessment on Hackerrank where it said I had two options: Programming or Programming + Math assessment. I intended to choose Programming + Math but when I clicked on Start Challenge and completed the assessment I could not see the math section so I'm writing this email to ask how can I access that part of the assessment or I am good to go?

            "Dear Cuong Luong,Thank you for submitting your cover letter and resume for the CAI3p0 Applied AI and Entrepreneurship Program. I have reviewed your materials and would like to offer some suggestions to help you strengthen your application:1. Content and Relevance:   - Clearly explain why you are interested in the CAI3p0 Applied AI and Entrepreneurship Program. While you have mentioned your enthusiasm, providing specific reasons related to the program's unique aspects will make your application stand out.   - Highlight your most relevant skills and experiences more effectively. For example, emphasize your work with natural language processing models and machine learning algorithms in the context of how they can benefit CAI3p0.   - Include a specific use case or project that you plan to work on during the program. This will demonstrate your proactive approach and clear vision for your participation.2. Specificity:   - Provide details about the potential business you have identified for the case study. Instead of placeholders like [Business Name], [Industry], and [Location], include the actual names and details.   - Explicitly state whether you have secured permission to work with the specific company. This will show your preparedness and commitment.3. Conversational AI Opportunity:   - Mention a specific conversational AI opportunity if applicable. Since the program focuses on applied AI, detailing a low-hanging fruit opportunity in conversational AI will increase your chances of being selected.Please revise your cover letter with these suggestions in mind and resubmit your application to the following URL: https://cai3p0.com/aw50zxjuc2hpcc1wcm9ncmftlwvtywlslwzpcnn0bmftzs1syxn0bmftzq.Feel free to reach out if you need further assistance or have any questions.
